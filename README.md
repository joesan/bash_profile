# bash_profile
A collection of bash profiles that I use for my Mac

## Pre-Requisites
1. Make sure to have lsd installed (https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)

## Additional Steps - Install Rust
Perform this to install Rust on a specific folder of your choice (in my case on Ubuntu, it is the /opt/softwares folder)

1. curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sudo RUSTUP_HOME=/opt/softwares/rustup sh -s -- -y
